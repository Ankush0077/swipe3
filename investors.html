            EXPECTATION FROM INVESTORS
        </strong>
    </h1>

    <p class="team-p3">
        We do not accept financial contributions from individuals.
We will only accept investment proposals from seasoned business owners and expert venture capitalists who have already traversed the terrain of entrepreneurship.
People who have never been through anything similar to this before will not be able to manage the challenges that come along with this trip since it is really difficult and it will have a lot of highs and lows.
Putting your money into a company is a very risky business move.
Even while we have a crystal-clear strategy and a fantastic staff to carry it out, there are still numerous elements at play.
It's a long-term plan with a minimum commitment of three years.
The goal is to create a great firm that will have a significant impact on the lives of people, and the accumulation of wealth is a happy outcome of this endeavour.
We are aiming for not just a significant effect but also significant rewards.

        <strong>
            The Ten SWIPE3 Principles That Should Guide Investments<br><br>
        </strong>
    </h1>

    <p class="principles-p3">
        1. Along the route to establishing a billion-dollar corporation, we want to provide excellent values for the people.<br><br>
        2. People who believed in us from the beginning need not worry; we want to keep things just the way they are and grow rapidly without compromising our essential values.<br><br>
        3. We want long-term partners that appreciate and cherish the goal and also assist us in expanding strategically rather than simply for the money. If you are just interested in doubling or tenfolding your investment, we may not be the right partner for you.<br><br>
        4. We don't offer mentors or brand ambassadors equity since they can't solve problems without context.<br><br>
        5. For the greater good, we must respect one another, allow room and independence, and recognise situational judgements.<br><br>
        6. We believe in people and place a higher emphasis on trust and word than on signed documents.<br><br>
        7. We are receptive to well-intentioned comments and ideas. You are welcome to make suggestions, but the final choices are always ours.<br><br>
        8. Mental tranquilly is crucial. At the end of the day, we must sleep happy, therefore let's move joyfully towards the vision and have faith in one another. This is a long-term partnership.<br><br>
        9. We will publish quarterly updates in addition to other crucial information. However, as an investor, you cannot participate in our daily operations and decisions.<br><br>
        10. We value your time and demand the same in return.<br>
